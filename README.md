This repository contains my own implementations of classic data structures in Java, including array list, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps, and more.

I built these from scratch to reinforce my understanding of core computer science concepts and to prepare for technical interviews. Each data structure is implemented in a clean and modular way.
